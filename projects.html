You can use Span to delegate tasks (using a system developed by the volunteer organization Reach4Help, a branch of Helpful Engineering), check in with team members, and track milestones as the project progresses. It's also easy to take part in an existing project: just submit a list of skills and interests, and Span will show you a list of recommended projects. Ultimately, we hope Span becomes a positive network of projects where anyone can find a place to develop their skills and pursue their interests.\
