*Channel Moderator:* [joshp007@stanford.edu Josh Payne]

=== Virufy: Low-cost early detection of COVID-19

*Team Lead:* Amil Khanzada

*Team Contact:* [amilkh@stanford.edu amilkh@stanford.edu]

*Current Team:* Nikki Perez, Frank Zheng, Lisa Chionis

*Description:* In collaboration with [https://ssuet.edu.pk/ Sir Syed University of Engineering and Technology] and [http://jig.jp/ jig.jp], we are leading an international innovative research project with the vision to build a smartphone app that can be used by anyone in the world (at home or in the hospital). It will use deep learning to determine whether they need to get further testing for COVID-19 based on audio/visual signals (e.g. cough sound, lung noise, video of face) + textual data (questionnaires). Did you know that videos of the face can be used to determine heart rate, blood oxygen level, respiratory rate, and stress levels?

We have Asian government/public health departments on board to gather data at hospitals shortly!

Check out our [http://virufy.org/ website].

*Looking for:* AI experts with experience in analyzing image\/sound processing for medical data (e.g. coughs, blood pressure), hospitals\/COVID-19 tested patients willing to share cough data with IRB approval, help to write grants.

=== mPCR (mobile PCR) Viral Diagnostic Device

*Team Lead:* Dr. Demir Akin

*Team Contact:* [demir.akin@stanford.edu demir.akin@stanford.edu]

*Description:* Extremely affordable, scalable testing (DNA\/RNA sequencing). More details \/ proposal [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/4/folders/1dwrl97KXw2WPabVcelha4dTgYF6y2t0p here].

We don't know if this ground-breaking research will succeed and don't know of anybody else working on it. If it works, we hope to share the system freely worldwide to help end this pandemic! 

*Looking for:* We need to replicate the existing devices or finalize the manufacturing ot the version 2 device. For this purpose we need team members with expertise in the following areas. People with: 
{{<div></div>}}
- EE background: hands-on PCB design, fabrication and circuit design experience, people who know and can directly communicate with PCB fabrication facilities vendors that have pick-and-place capability AND can offer their service free or donate\/discount their servies for a non-profit cause
- analog an digital signal processing experience, especially with exp with microcontrollers, Arduino, or similar microcontrollers
- 3D printing experince to fabricate a case for the device so it can be safely distributed to the public
- Android\/iOS App\/GUI developers
- business backgrounds, people who have previously been involved in start up creation, have connections to or willing to connect with angel investors, ventures/foundations etc., people with social media, and outreach experience
- people with RT-PCR and molecular biology expertise to run the inital validation tests with simulants (not clincal samples)
- people with BSL-3 lab experince and access to such contolled regulation labs for perfoming the validation testing with clinical samples (this need will come later on but forming a team from get-go is critical for rapid respnse to this pandemic)

Deliver system in polystyrene nanoparticle vessel. Have asymptomatic people do intranasal sprays, to essentially nip the virus in the bud. Whether someone actually has the virus or not shouldn't matter, as the target sequences are known through well-established PCR protocols to be virus-specific.
